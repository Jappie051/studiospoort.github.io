# 2024-5-18 — Three Hovens

This update focusses around HOV1 (pink bundle) connecting Eindhoven Centraal to Veldhoven and Meerhoven. Making everything fit, especially line 14 and 114, required some creativity.

# 2024-5-13 — To the West

This update saw the map getting extended along the southwestern BRT corridor HOV4 (orange bundle) - headed towards the MMC Veldhoven Hospital and the ASML campus. Figuring out the routing surrounding Kastelenplein and the Hospital bus station were the challenges here.

# 2024-5-7 — Slight Expansion and Colour Change

The colours of the map have gotten overhaul to improve the readability of the map and better show line bunders. It also makes the map prettier.
Furthermore, stops in the Town of Aalst have been added. Buurtbus 271 was particularly challenging to figure out how to map, that line is such a mess :').

First step in the process was making the base design for lines and stops, which turned out as follows:

The top assets are used for regular and BRT lines. The smaller assets are used for local (buurtbus) and school lines.

Then, using the official [network map](https://www.connexxion.nl/getmedia/cf293c65-ec11-43da-b8aa-54b1ee4c3d39/Hermes_Zuidoost_Brabant_Lijnennetkaart_2024.pdf), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and the [OVNL-Wiki](https://wiki.ovinnederland.nl/wiki/Concessie_Zuidoost-Brabant_(2017-2026)) as sources, I begun drawing the schematic map from scratch, starting with Eindhoven Centraal and the city centre.
