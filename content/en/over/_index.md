Hey there, welcome to my site! :D
I'm Jasper, a 19 year old Dutch student at the Dept of the Built Environment at TU/e.
This site is a place for my projects, be it hobbies, schoolwork or proffesional stuff.
I'm mostly interested in stuff like urbanism and public transit.

You can reach me in the following places:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Jappie051/studiospoort.github.io)
- [Email](mailto:jasper.schiebaan@gmail.com) (Only for proffesional use)
